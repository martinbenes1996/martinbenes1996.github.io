Living in mountains, I get many opportunities to ask myself the most fundamental question: "Can a sheep herd be modelled similarly to fluid dynamics?" Today, we are gonna use cellular automaton to finally find the answer.

## Observing sheep

For those who has never left the subway system of a metropolitan area, sheep tent to stick close to the herd, in order to stay safe.

"Following like a sheep" describes the herd movements pretty accurately.

As a result, a sheep herd on a large grass area behaves like a white liquid on green background, floating around gray rocks and cliffs.

## Cellular automaton

Cellular automaton is a model of spatial interactions. Its typical application are fluid dynamics, meteorology, civil engineering, epidemiology, or ecology.

The model is a regular lattice of cells, each holding a state.
There is a handful of possible states; in our case, it will be `empty`, `sheep`, and later `predator`.
The model evolves over time, based on the neighborhood of each cell.

Apart from space, the model also captures time: typically, as a discrete axis, i.e., $0$, $1$, $2$, ..., along which the state of the model evolves. The change in state determines the interactions, and is defined regressively, from time $k$ to $k+1$.

Finally, we should address the elephant in the room. Yes, our sheep will be square-shaped.

## Modelling the herd with cellular automaton

Let's have a large, grass area, decomposed into square segments. Each square is either empty, or has a square-shaped sheep standing on it. We initialize the space by randomly dropping sheep around the area.


```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image

# actors

EMPTY = 0
SHEEP = 1
TOURIST = 2

# randomly spread sheep around the area

rng = np.random.default_rng(12345)
area = rng.choice([EMPTY, SHEEP], size=(50, 50), p=[.95, .05])
print('Generated', np.sum(area == SHEEP), 'sheep.')

# plot the area

A = np.zeros((*area.shape, 3), dtype='uint8')
A[area == EMPTY] = [0, 128, 0]
A[area == SHEEP] = [255, 255, 255]
plt.imshow(A);
```

    Generated 135 sheep.

Next, we get the sheep moving. For visualizing time-dependent heatmaps, we use `pillow` and store them in as GIF images.

Cellular automaton is defined via behavior of an individual.
Individuals define the movement based on the current state, reacting to what happens in the neighborhood.
In our case, we must define "the sheep logic".

### Sheep logic

The schema below shows the logic of sheep. Sheep tries to run towards the local herd centroid. Later we will also introduce the tourists that sheep runs from and extend the sheep movements towards Moore.

A sheep first estimates a herd centroid. Then it considers possible moves (up, down, left, right, stay), and weights them by the dot product with the vector towards the centroid. What this means is that directions getting the sheep towards the centroid get positive, larger score, and directions away from centroid get negative score.

Finally, the scores are converted to probabilities using the softmax function, and the direction is drawn randomly, according to the probabilities.


```python
def score_to_direction(score):

    # softmax score

    p_sum = np.sum(np.exp(list(score.values())))
    p = {k: np.exp(v) / p_sum for k, v in score.items()}

    # draw randomly

    direction = rng.choice(list(p.keys()), p=list(p.values()))
    return direction
```


```python
def sheep_logic(area_win, loc, glob, lim):
    # sheep centroid

    sheep = np.array(list(zip(*np.where(area_win == SHEEP))))
    ctr = np.mean(sheep, axis=0) if len(sheep[0]) > 0 else np.array(loc)
    # gravity score

    score = {
        tuple(k): np.array(k) @ (ctr - loc)
        for k in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]
    }
    # check

    for direction, in_area in [
        [(-1, 0), glob[0] > lim[0][0]],
        [(0, -1), glob[1] > lim[0][1]],
        [(+1, 0), glob[0] < lim[1][0]-1],
        [(0, +1), glob[1] < lim[1][1]-1],
    ]:
        # do not roam outside the area

        if not in_area:
            score[direction] = -np.inf
        # the next square must be empty

        elif area[x_glob+direction[0], y_glob+direction[1]] != EMPTY:
            score[direction] = -np.inf

    # direction according to score

    return score_to_direction(score)
```

We test our function for $100$ time steps, on an area of $75\times75$ squares with $5\%$ sheep.
Each sheep only sees $15\times15$ pixels around it.


```python
# initialize sheep area

rng = np.random.default_rng(12345)
area = rng.choice([EMPTY, SHEEP], size=(75, 75), p=[.95, .05])

# parameters

win_size = 15
clamp = lambda x, dim: np.clip(x, 0, area.shape[dim])

# run

frames = []
for step in range(50):

    frame = np.zeros((*area.shape, 3), dtype='uint8')
    for x_glob, y_glob in zip(*np.where((area == SHEEP))):
        object_type = area[x_glob, y_glob]

        # Moore View neighborhood

        win_min = clamp(x_glob-win_size//2, 0), clamp(y_glob-win_size//2, 1)
        win_max = clamp(x_glob+win_size//2+1, 0), clamp(y_glob+win_size//2+1, 1)
        area_win = area[win_min[0]:win_max[0], win_min[1]:win_max[1]]
        x_loc, y_loc = x_glob - win_min[0], y_glob - win_min[1]

        # Sheep logic

        direction = sheep_logic(area_win, [x_loc, y_loc], [x_glob, y_glob], [win_min, win_max])

        # Add to frame

        frame[area == EMPTY] = [0, 128, 0]
        frame[area == SHEEP] = [255, 255, 255]

        # Move

        area[x_glob, y_glob] = EMPTY
        area[x_glob+direction[0], y_glob+direction[1]] = object_type

    frames.append(Image.fromarray(frame))
frames[0].save("image.gif", save_all=True, append_images=frames[1:])
```

The sheep cluster together, but nothing really pushes them into moving further. The sub-herds do not see each other, as their centroids are more than $7$ blocks apart.

## Adding the tourists

Let us make it more interesting. Let's add tourists. Tourists run towards the sheep.


```python
tourist_factor = .2  # factor controlling how much tourists run after the sheep
```


```python
def tourist_logic(area_win, loc, glob, lim):

    # sheep centroid

    sheep = list(zip(*np.where(area_win == SHEEP)))
    if len(sheep) > 0:
        ctr = np.mean(sheep, axis=0)
    else:
        ctr = np.array(loc)
    # gravity score (towards sheep)

    score = {
        tuple(k): np.array(k) @ (ctr - loc)
        for k in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]
    }

    # check

    for direction, in_area in [
        [(-1, 0), glob[0] > lim[0][0]],
        [(0, -1), glob[1] > lim[0][1]],
        [(+1, 0), glob[0] < lim[1][0]-1],
        [(0, +1), glob[1] < lim[1][1]-1],
    ]:
        # do not roam outside the area

        if not in_area:
            score[direction] = -np.inf
        # the next square must be empty

        elif area[x_glob+direction[0], y_glob+direction[1]] != EMPTY:
            score[direction] = -np.inf

        score[direction] *= tourist_factor

    # direction according to score

    return score_to_direction(score)
```

Sheep are afraid of tourists, and run away from them.


```python
fear_factor = 10  # how much are sheep afraid of tourists
```


```python
def sheep_logic(area_win, loc, glob, lim):

    # sheep centroid

    ctr = np.mean(list(zip(*np.where(area_win == SHEEP))), axis=0)
    # gravity score (towards sheep centroid)

    score_sheep = {
        tuple(k): np.array(k) @ np.array(ctr - loc)
        for k in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]
    }

    # anti-gravity score (from tourists)

    tourists = np.array(list(zip(*np.where(area_win == TOURIST))))
    score_tourist = {
        tuple(k): min([*[
            np.array(k) @ (np.array(tourist) - loc)
            for tourist in tourists
        ], 0])
        for k in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (0, 0)]
    }
    if any([np.sum(np.abs(tourist - loc)) < 3 for tourist in tourists]):
        score_tourist[(0, 0)] = np.inf  # don't stay still when people are around

    # combine both scores

    score = {
        k: score_sheep[k] - fear_factor * score_tourist[k]
        for k in score_sheep
    }

    # check

    for direction, in_area in [
        [(-1, 0), glob[0] > lim[0][0]],
        [(0, -1), glob[1] > lim[0][1]],
        [(+1, 0), glob[0] < lim[1][0]-1],
        [(0, +1), glob[1] < lim[1][1]-1],
    ]:
        # do not roam outside the area

        if not in_area:
            score[direction] = -np.inf
        # the next square must be empty

        elif area[x_glob+direction[0], y_glob+direction[1]] != EMPTY:
            score[direction] = -100

    # direction according to score

    return score_to_direction(score)
```

We plug both together. We populate $5\%$ with sheep, and $0.2\%$ with tourists.


```python
# initialize sheep area

rng = np.random.default_rng(12345)
area = rng.choice([EMPTY, SHEEP, TOURIST], size=(75, 75), p=[.949, .05, .001])

# parameters

win_size = 15

# run

frames = []
for step in range(50):

    frame = np.zeros((*area.shape, 3), dtype='uint8')
    for x_glob, y_glob in zip(*np.where(area != EMPTY)):
        object_type = area[x_glob, y_glob]

        # Moore View neighborhood

        win_min = clamp(x_glob-win_size//2, 0), clamp(y_glob-win_size//2, 1)
        win_max = clamp(x_glob+win_size//2+1, 0), clamp(y_glob+win_size//2+1, 1)
        area_win = area[win_min[0]:win_max[0], win_min[1]:win_max[1]]
        x_loc, y_loc = x_glob - win_min[0], y_glob - win_min[1]

        # Sheep logic

        if object_type == SHEEP:
            direction = sheep_logic(area_win, [x_loc, y_loc], [x_glob, y_glob], [win_min, win_max])
        elif object_type == TOURIST:
            direction = tourist_logic(area_win, [x_loc, y_loc], [x_glob, y_glob], [win_min, win_max])

        # Add to frame

        frame[area == EMPTY] = [0, 128, 0]
        frame[area == SHEEP] = [255, 255, 255]

        # Move

        area[x_glob, y_glob] = EMPTY
        area[x_glob+direction[0], y_glob+direction[1]] = object_type

    frames.append(Image.fromarray(frame))
frames[0].save("image.gif", save_all=True, append_images=frames[1:])
```

Nice! The sheep are (moderately) avoiding the tourists, which breaks the clusters.

## Moves like Moore

Final modification is to replace the von Neumann neighborhood movement with Moore movement.


```python
def tourist_logic(area_win, loc, glob, lim):

    # sheep centroid

    sheep = list(zip(*np.where(area_win == SHEEP)))
    if len(sheep) > 0:
        ctr = np.mean(sheep, axis=0)
    else:
        ctr = np.array(loc)
    # gravity score (towards sheep)

    score = {
        tuple(k): np.array(k) @ (ctr - loc)
        for k in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (0, 0)]
    }

    # check

    for direction, in_area in [
        [(-1, 0), glob[0] > lim[0][0]],
        [(0, -1), glob[1] > lim[0][1]],
        [(+1, 0), glob[0] < lim[1][0]-1],
        [(0, +1), glob[1] < lim[1][1]-1],
        [(-1, +1), (glob[0] > lim[0][0]) & (glob[1] < lim[1][1]-1)],
        [(+1, -1), (glob[0] < lim[1][0]-1) & (glob[1] > lim[0][1])],
        [(-1, -1), (glob[0] > lim[0][0]) & (glob[1] > lim[0][1])],
        [(+1, +1), (glob[0] < lim[1][0]-1) & (glob[1] < lim[1][1]-1)],
    ]:
        # do not roam outside the area

        if not in_area:
            score[direction] = -np.inf
        # the next square must be empty

        elif area[x_glob+direction[0], y_glob+direction[1]] != EMPTY:
            score[direction] = -np.inf

        score[direction] *= tourist_factor

    # direction according to score

    return score_to_direction(score)
```


```python
def sheep_logic(area_win, loc, glob, lim):

    # sheep centroid

    sheep = np.array(list(zip(*np.where(area_win == SHEEP))))
    ctr = np.mean(sheep, axis=0) if len(sheep[0]) > 0 else np.array(loc)
    # gravity score (towards sheep centroid)

    score_sheep = {
        tuple(k): np.array(k) @ np.array(ctr - loc)
        for k in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (0, 0)]
    }

    # anti-gravity score (from tourists)

    tourists = np.array(list(zip(*np.where(area_win == TOURIST))))
    score_tourist = {
        tuple(k): min([*[
            np.array(k) @ (np.array(tourist) - loc)
            for tourist in tourists
        ], 0])
        for k in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1), (-1, -1), (0, 0)]
    }
    if any([np.sum(np.abs(tourist - loc)) < 3 for tourist in tourists]):
        score_tourist[(0, 0)] = np.inf  # don't stay still when tourists are around

    # combine both scores

    score = {
        k: score_sheep[k] - fear_factor * score_tourist[k]
        for k in score_sheep
    }

    # check

    for direction, in_area in [
        [(-1, 0), glob[0] > lim[0][0]],
        [(0, -1), glob[1] > lim[0][1]],
        [(+1, 0), glob[0] < lim[1][0]-1],
        [(0, +1), glob[1] < lim[1][1]-1],
        [(-1, +1), (glob[0] > lim[0][0]) & (glob[1] < lim[1][1]-1)],
        [(+1, -1), (glob[0] < lim[1][0]-1) & (glob[1] > lim[0][1])],
        [(-1, -1), (glob[0] > lim[0][0]) & (glob[1] > lim[0][1])],
        [(+1, +1), (glob[0] < lim[1][0]-1) & (glob[1] < lim[1][1]-1)],
    ]:
        # do not roam outside the area

        if not in_area:
            score[direction] = -np.inf
        # the next square must be empty

        elif area[x_glob+direction[0], y_glob+direction[1]] != EMPTY:
            score[direction] = -100

    # direction according to score

    return score_to_direction(score)
```

The rest of the code remains the same.

This modification makes the movement way more organic. The sheep seem to have now more flexibility to avoid the tourists.

## Conclusion

The movements using simple cellular automaton look organic. The answer to the question from the intro would be:

The proposed automaton can simulate movement of a sheep herd for square-shaped sheep.
